            "Reparations in the form of one-time payments does not seem feasible. Even if it were feasible, I think it would do irreparable dammage to the black community. Exemption from paying taxes for a few generations has some advantages and I think it's worth considering.",

            "<b>One</b>. It is as cost-effective as it gets. It does not require existing resources. The cost is spread across the nation and distributed over several generations in the form of slightly lower budgets. Cost-wise, this is the most manageable form of returning part of the wealth owed.",

            "<b>Two</b>. It is not a handout, but a bonus contingent on taxable income and proportional with said income. This makes it is compatible with American values.",


            "<b>Three</b>. The opportunity to abuse it is minimal, since only taxable income gets rewarded. Furthermore, it would allow and encourage long-term planning, hard work, investing in one’s skills and education, staying out of trouble, etc. - all of which are good predictors of a healthy and prosperous society.",

            "<b>Four</b>. It allows for the accumulation of generational wealth.",

            "I'm not sure there is a good or fair way to repair the damage. This approach reconciles to an extent the social cost with the objective of returning wealth, so maybe it's worth considering."

By the time I finished high-school, I was missing more than half of my adult teeth. The extent of the damage was masked by veneers, bridges, and changing dentists a few times. I remained unaware of my condition until college. Take some time to absorb this."
