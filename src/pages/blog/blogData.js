            "Hello, I'm Dr. Andrei Popa, computational scientist and green card holder for research in national interest (E26).",

            "I'm writing this on May 30, 2023. It is my 10th day of fasting and the first day without water. I'm doing this to protest the fact that Emory University admitted me in a PhD program with no intention of giving me credit for my work or acknowldging my credentials. They worked me for years, robbed me of my intellectual property, and then ruined my life.",

            "It's been more than a decade of gaslighting, and shenanigans that took shocking forms. Meanwhile, my research and ideas are being slowly syphoned in publications, but attributed to others (in more or less subtle ways). ",

            "I am wounded and indignated. The people that are doing this to me are people I've come to trust over the years, people I was fond of. Mentors, lab mates, committee members, recommenders (jobs & green card), faculty and staff who hugged me cordially on graduation day, congratulated me, and wished me all the best. ",


            "I hope that they - Emory, the powers that be - will eventually hear me and make things right, because I will not abandon my identity as a researcher. I spent 17 years cultivating it, I'm good at it, and there's nothing else I care about than taking it further, but as me, not as a ghost researcher.",

            "My life is in God's hands now because I will not eat or drink until I'm heard. Either way, four days or fourty years, I'll be at my station, continuing my work.",


            "Sincerely,",
            "Andrei",

            // "All my efforts to make this stop and to produce valuable work ended up fueling more and more careers of academics that belong to the right circles but don't have ideas for theses or dissertations, let alone the vision to develop research programs. These academics get mine and I get to watch my world sink under their carreers.",


            // "I'll keep to my daily routine, research, walks, coding, reconnecting with a spiritual dimmension of myself, playing with my Rubik cubes, cleaning, repeat.",

            // "It's a lot to unpack, I know, and I wish I had more  Speaking of being ignored, a good place to start is the interaction with Emory's Office for Research Integrity"

            "I've lost my family, and yet there they are, walking and talking, poisoning everything they touch. Does anyone have a pamflet on how to cope with this? If I come up with something, I'll let you know. If you're like me, reach out.",

            "Teeth grinding during sleep, or bruxism, can be neutralized with a mouth gard - a silicone thingy that prevents contact between lower and upper teeth. My parents, however, hid this from me; not the solution, the condition itself. By the age of ten I was intimate with oral surgery. By the time I finished high-school, I was missing more than half of my adult teeth. The extent of the damage was masked by veneers, bridges, and changing dentists a few times. I remained unaware of my condition until college. Take some time to absorb this. "

Six months later I was too demoralized to continue, so I took a leave of absence from which no one thought I will return.",

I learned this from Viorel's son, Cosmin Panait. He was an undergrad at Emory while I was in grad school. There he became my fake friend, a spy for my parents, and a source of misinformation about me.",

Kathrine Jayne, now lawyer; Alison Yourick, now lawyer; Sarah Skinner, now prosecutor; Natalie Liem, now lawyer in the social security administration.",

            "Years went by and I was doing well. Seeing that I don't quit they tried to exhaust me, but I loved the research too much to be deterred (or to notice what they were doing). The more they tried, the better I got and, little by little, I became the scholar McDowell pretends to be.",

            "Something had to be done, apparently, and they found the right man for the job: Ralph Woolfolk, a young and ambitious detective with Atlanta PD. He fabricated an allegation of rape against me, pretended to investigate it, and interviewed my recommenders in the process. My attorneys (Aurora and LaScala) played along, making the whole thing appear legit. With no intention to arrest me, they ended my career before it began.",

            "The next years were just mental anguish and desperate attempts to prove my worth as a scholar. These attempts ended up boosting the careers of other posers (e.g., Keneth Carter)."
