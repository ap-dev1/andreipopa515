        keywords: ["", "", "", "", ""],
        abstract: "Having multiple options is appealing in our everyday lives, arguably because it allows for a flexible future. Some studies, however, showed that people may be less satisfied when presented with multiple options. This project investigated whether people preferred to keep their options open (so to speak) by arranging an asymmetrical, continuous choice environment. It was hypothesized that people will work to keep their options open even if it limits acquiring the maximum number of points. Seven Agnes Scott students responded on concurrent Random Interval (RI) schedules of reinforcement. The overall rate of reinforcement was constant, but one target class delivered higher-magnitude reinforcers (5 points vs. 1 point). However, the target class with the lower reinforcer magnitude (1 reinforcer = 1 point) shrank in size when not selected for ten or more consecutive seconds. Every ten-second interval would reduce its size by one fourth of its original size and every new response would increase its size by one fourth (or, if at original size, reset the ten-second interval). Results showed preference for the shrinking class (b ~ 0.9), even though reinforcer magnitude on this class was five times smaller. This suggests that participants preferred to keep their options open, even if meant acquiring a lower overall payoff."

        abstract: "This study examines the effectiveness of art by means of geometric and spatial relations as a means of therapy for anxiety - based disorders.Recent studies on the nature of trypophobia(fear of holes) suggest that specific geometrical arrangements, such as high contrast midrange spatial frequency images, may automatically trigger feelings of discomfort(Cole & Wilkins, 2013).The purpose of this study is twofold: to replicate the findings reported by Cole and Wilkins(2013) and to explore the extent to which the phenomenon can be reversed.Participants will be exposed to similar stimuli as those used by Cole & Wilkins(2013) via a computer program.They will be asked to rate their level of discomfort and provide a short explanation of why.They will then be asked to manipulate the images using(i.e., re - arrange the elements) using the mouse until the level of discomfort decreases.Each resulting image, as well as the stroke paths, will be recorded and analyzed for concurrences of basic geometric shapes and / or arrangements that help reduce anxiety.The overarching goal is to be able to produce personalized visual stimuli that reduce anxiety, thus increasing the level of personalization and effectiveness of therapeutic approaches to anxiety."

        abstract: "One way to eliminate behaviors form an organism’s repertoire is to identify and remove the reinforcing contingencies that maintain them.This procedure is referred to as extinction.Extinction is known to be accompanied by a short increase in behavior frequency, intensity, and variability.In this project, we examined various properties of choice behavior before and after extinction was implemented.Preliminary results showed that the frequency of both target and extraneous(non - target) responses increased during the extinction phase.The effect was more pronounced for extraneous responses, possibly for their exploratory potential.Future analysis will focus on various measures of variability before and after reinforcement is withdrawn."

        abstract: "In concurrent schedule procedures, humans exhibit lower sensitivity to reinforcement than non - humans(McDowell, 2013), possibly because points may not be as reinforcing for humans as food is for non - humans.We hypothesized that an environment that creates the impression of competition may increase the reinforcing value of points.Two groups of participants(competition vs.non - competition) responded for 18 minutes in a continuous - choice procedure that arranged concurrent, independent Random Interval(RI) schedule; the target classes were invisible to both groups.Preliminary analyses showed that sensitivity to reinforcement, contrary to our hypothesis, was not noticeably higher in the competition condition.These results showed that competition by itself may not be sufficient to increase motivation.Several potential explanations are discussed, including the perceived relevance(or lack thereof) of the activity."

        abstract: "The purpose of this study was to explore properties of choice behavior when the target classes that have the potential for reinforcement were hidden.Twenty - four Agnes Scott students were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions.In one condition an unpleasant sound was made contingent on each response that occurred outside a target region.In the second condition, extraneous responses were not signaled.In both conditions, reinforced responses resulted in one point and a pleasant sound.Target responses that were not reinforced were never signaled.We hypothesized that the condition with feedback 1) will elicit higher accuracy in locating the target classes and 2) will produce lower levels of behavioral variability.Preliminary results appear to confirm the hypotheses."
