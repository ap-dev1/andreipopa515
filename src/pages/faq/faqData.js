        question: "Are you religious now?",
        answer: ["More like I'm allowing myself to nurture a spiritual dimension of life, in the context of Christian faith. This dimension was smothered in childhood and remained dormant until I bannished my parents from my heart. It does not replace my worldview or value system, it enriches it by nurtuting a human need that cannot be fulfilled by scientific inquiry.",
            "It helped me become more contemplative, to talk less, and to examine myself more. One think I'm coming to terms with is a history of ridicule towards pious people.",
            "That was misguided, wrong, and gratuitous. My shallow take on faith was instilled in me since childhood. Like many other views from that time, I internalized it without scrutinizing it and I didn’t challenge it or questioned its origins until recently. I should have done that sooner, or at least keep my mouth shut and be considerate of people’s feelings. I failed all three: I didn’t scrutinize, I didn’t keep my mouth shut, and I wasn’t considerate with people’s feelings. I know better now."

        question: "How can I tell if someone is a nazi?",
        answer: ["I was in high school, 16-17 years old, when this new kid joined our class. He was assigned the seat next to me. A few weeks into the semester he brings a book for me to read because, he said, he thought I might appreciate it. I felt insulted. A few weeks later he did it again, with a different book. We stopped talking after that. The first book was the satanist bible, the second was hitler's kampf. In both cases I felt insulted and confused. I couldn't understand why he thought those books would appeal to me, it didn't make any sense.",
            "It took 25 years to realize that those were part of my mother's attempts to stir me wrong, that she was already telling people all sorts of lies about me, which is how I started wondering: how can one tell? If someone tells you that the person you just started dating is a closeted (discreet?) nazi, how can you tell?",
            "What I came up with is to ask them what's wrong with the nazi doctrine. Anything short of a clear, unequivocal answer is a red flag. Some will say that a person may simply not have the vocabulary or the knowledge required for a good answer (genocide is bad, mkay?). True, but then you're dealing with an adult who has a hard time denouncing genocide, and I'm not sure that's a good sign. Lucky for us, walking away from a situation does not require proof or permission.",

    //     question: "What does it mean to admire someone?",

        question: "What makes a person stupid?",

        answer: ["There's no such thing, it's just an insult. I started thinking about this seriously when I taught at GSU, 2012-2015. I had more than 3000 students during that time, from all walks of life. Whenever a student underperformed, it was lack of resources, anxiety, indiference, lack of information, but never some magic deficit. I couldn't even formulate a tentative definition because in every thought experiment I ran, I could explain sub-optimal outcomes in simpler ways. I was not able to find room or need for \"stupidity\". Like I said, just an insult."]

        question: "Reparations in the form of two centuries of tax exemption? What are you thinking?",
        answer: ["I’m thinking that the lump-sum idea is not feasible and would do more harm than good. If implemented, I doubt that the black community will ever recover. Exemption from paying taxes addresses many of the problems posed by a one-time payment.",

            "No resources are taken from anywhere. The cost of reparations is spread across the nation and distributed over several generations, in the form of slightly lower budgets: loss of future revenue, spread over several generations. Cost-wise, this is the most manageable form of returning part of the wealth owed. Because it goes on for several generations it allows for the accumulation of generational wealth, which is another plus.",

            "Because it is not a handout, but a bonus contingent on taxable income and proportional with said income, it is compatible with American values: everyone can participate, no one gets anything for free, criminals don’t get paid, etc. Just the opposite: it would allow and encourage long-term planning, hard work, investing in one’s skills and education, staying out of trouble, etc. - all good predictors of a healthy and prosperous society.",

            "There is no good or fair way to repair what was broken, but we have to begin somewhere. A one-time payment would be a mistake, anyway one looks at it. Tax exemptions for a few generations seems feasible cost-wise and would promote healthy values and behaviors. What do you think? Am I missing something or this is worth exploring? Let me know in the comments."

    {
        question: "Is the brain a recorder?",

        answer: ["Every textbook says no. I say they are all wrong (Popa, 2019). The brain is what a recorder would look like and function like if it were \'designed\' via trial and error by a non-intelligent being that knows nothing about the brain or the world. Its architecture is complex but the principles that explain its relation to psychology and, by extension, sociology are simple. It is effective in keeping its shell alive, but is poorly suited for sentience. So yes, the brain is a very bad recorder. "]

        question: "What does it mean to care about someone?",

        answer: ["What do you point to to say “See, that’s me caring”. It has to be outside of what’s obvious, like wishing happy birthday, being polite, stuff that are present even when the members of the couple don’t actually care about each other. Here’s what I pointed to when asked (unprompted is in bad taste). This event took place relatively in our relationship. It’s Friday evening. I’m ready for the weekend and for a cozy evening with my gf. I arrived at her place at 4pm, earlier than expected. She was supposed to arrive around 5pm. She had given me a key for this eventuality. I let myself in to discover that her dog had an accident all over the living room floor. After I saw that Daisy was fine I took a look around, sighed, and made it sparkle by the time she got home. I could have closed the door, walk away, and come back later as if nothing happened. It was a pleasant evening."]

Speaking of which, I've come to suspect I might be the result of rape. I recently asked my mother directly. Her response was so confusing that I'm not even sure it counts as denial."]

    {
        question: "Why didn't you say something earlier?",
        answer: ["Fear, shame, guilt, denial. Fear was induced and maintained via physical, psychological, and emotional violence. I wasn't always a six feet tall, 43 years old scholar. I was once an infant at the whim of my parents. They weren't kind to me, gravitating around child neglect, child abuse, and up to 3-4 years old, child molestation."]

    // {
    //     question: "How come they didn't evict you?",
    //     answer: ["I'm not sure. I suspect that they are reluctant to take me to court because it would confirm that I lived at this address since 2014 (1165 Briarcliff Court NE, apartment 5, Atlanta, GA, 30306). If that is the case, they have at least two options. One would be to get an eviction order behind my back, without giving me the chance to speak to a judge. Another option would be to bypass the court completely, push me out some other way, like turning off the power, cut me access to the apartment, or something along these lines."]
