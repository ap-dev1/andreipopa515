        question: "Are you religious now?",
        answer: ["More like I'm allowing myself to nurture a spiritual dimension of life, in the context of Christian faith. This dimension was smothered in childhood and remained dormant until I bannished my parents from my heart. It does not replace my worldview or value system, it enriches it by nurtuting a human need that cannot be fulfilled by scientific inquiry.",
            "It helped me become more contemplative, to talk less, and to examine myself more. Speaking of self-examination, I'm really sorry I ridiculed pious people.",
            "That was misguided, wrong, and gratuitous. My shallow take on faith was instilled in me since childhood. Like many other views from that time, I internalized it without scrutinizing it and I didn’t challenge it or questioned its origins until recently. I should have done that sooner, or at least keep my mouth shut and be considerate of people’s feelings. I failed all three: I didn’t scrutinize, I didn’t keep my mouth shut, and I wasn’t considerate with people’s feelings. I know better now."

            // "I was in high school, 16-17 years old, when this new kid joined our class. He was assigned the seat next to me. A few weeks into the semester he brings a book for me to read because, he said, he thought I might appreciate it. I felt insulted. A few weeks later he did it again, with a different book. We stopped talking after that. The first book was the satanist bible, the second was hitler's kampf. In both cases I felt insulted and confused. I couldn't understand why he thought those books would appeal to me, it didn't make any sense.",

            "I was in high school, 16-17 years old, when this new kid joined our class. He was assigned the seat next to me. A few weeks into the semester he brings a copy of his kamph for me to read because, he said, he thought I might appreciate it. I spent the next hour skimming through it. It was exactly what I expected it to be: gaslighting, scapegoating, and genocide dressed as necessity, strength, and valor. I felt insulted by the fact that he assumed that because I felt sad and frustrated in a collapsing world I lost my capacity or willingness to think and empathize. It didn't make any sense.",

            "It took 25 years to realize that those were part of my mother's attempts to stir me wrong, that she was already telling people all sorts of lies about me, which is how I started wondering: how can one tell? If someone tells you that the person you just started dating is a closeted (discreet?) nazi, how can you tell?",
            "What I came up with is to ask them what's wrong with the nazi doctrine. Anything short of a clear, unequivocal answer is a red flag. Some will say that a person may simply not have the vocabulary or the knowledge required for a good answer (genocide is bad, mkay?). True, but then you're dealing with an adult who has a hard time denouncing genocide, and I'm not sure that's a good sign. Lucky for us, walking away from a situation does not require proof or permission.",

I had more than 3000 students during that time, from all walks of life. Whenever a student underperformed, it was lack of resources, anxiety, indiference, lack of information, but never some magic deficit. I couldn't even formulate a tentative definition because in every thought experiment I ran, I could explain sub-optimal outcomes in simpler ways. I was not able to find room or need for \"stupidity\". Like I said, just an insult."]

        answer: ["Every textbook says no. I say they are all wrong (Popa, 2019). The brain is what a recorder would look like and function like if it were \'designed\' via trial and error by a non-intelligent being that knows nothing about the brain or the world. Its architecture is complex but the principles that explain its relation to psychology and, by extension, sociology are simple. It is effective in keeping its shell alive, but is poorly suited for sentience. So yes, the brain is a very bad recorder. "]

It has to be outside of what’s obvious, like wishing happy birthday, being polite, stuff that are present even when the members of the couple don’t actually care about each other. Here’s what I answered. Picture it: Friday evening, relatively early in the relationship. I’m ready for the weekend and for a cozy evening with my gf. I arrived at her place at 4pm, before her. I expected her around 5pm. She had given me a key so I let myself in, to discover that her dog had an accident all over the living room. I made sure Daisy was fine, I took a look around, I sighed, and made it sparkle by the time my gf got home. I could have closed the door, walk away, and come back later as if nothing happened. It was a pleasant evening. Look, caring."]

        question: "Why are you being so open about such personal matters?",
        answer: ["I'm done pretending. I grew up conditioned to think that standing up for myself makes me a bad person, an agressor. I let people walk all over me and I always reacted too late or not at all. Speaking up requires a lot of me and I would rather not do this, but I don't feel I have a choice. If I don't speak up for myself no one will. I think my life has value even if others refuse to see it. "]

If that is the case, they have at least two options. One would be to get an eviction order behind my back, without giving me the chance to speak to a judge. Another option would be to bypass the court completely, push me out some other way, like turning off the power, cut me access to the apartment, or something along these lines."]
