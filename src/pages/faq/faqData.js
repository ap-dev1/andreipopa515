        question: "Is the brain a recorder?",

        answer: ["Every textbook says no. I say they are all wrong (Popa, 2019). The brain is what a recorder would look like and function like if it were \'designed\' via trial and error by a non-intelligent being that knows nothing about the brain or the world. Its architecture is complex but the principles that explain its relation to psychology and, by extension, sociology are simple. It is effective in keeping its shell alive, but is poorly suited for sentience. So yes, the brain is a very bad recorder. "]

This dimension was smothered in childhood and remained dormant until I bannished my parents from my heart. It does not replace my worldview or value system, it enriches it by nurtuting a human need that cannot be fulfilled by scientific inquiry.",
            "It helped me become more contemplative, to talk less, and to examine myself more. Speaking of self-examination, I'm really sorry I ridiculed pious people.",
            "That was misguided, wrong, and gratuitous. My shallow take on faith was instilled in me since childhood. Like many other views from that time, I internalized it without scrutinizing it and I didn’t challenge it or questioned its origins until recently. I should have done that sooner, or at least keep my mouth shut and be considerate of people’s feelings. I failed all three: I didn’t scrutinize, I didn’t keep my mouth shut, and I wasn’t considerate with people’s feelings. I know better now."

I had more than 3000 students during that time, from all walks of life. Whenever a student underperformed, it was lack of resources, anxiety, indiference, lack of information, but never some magic deficit. I couldn't even formulate a tentative definition because in every thought experiment I ran, I could explain sub-optimal outcomes in simpler ways. I was not able to find room or need for \"stupidity\". Like I said, just an insult."]

We stopped talking after that. The first book was the satanist bible, the second was hitler's kampf. In both cases I felt insulted and confused. I couldn't understand why he thought those books would appeal to me, it didn't make any sense.",

A few weeks into the semester he brings a copy of his kamph for me to read because, he said, he thought I might appreciate it. I spent the next hour skimming through it. It was exactly what I expected it to be: gaslighting, scapegoating, and genocide dressed as necessity, strength, and valor. I felt insulted by the fact that he assumed that because I felt sad and frustrated in a collapsing world I lost my capacity or willingness to think and empathize. It didn't make any sense.",

            "What I came up with is to ask them what's wrong with the nazi doctrine. Anything short of a clear, unequivocal answer is a red flag. Some will say that a person may simply not have the vocabulary or the knowledge required for a good answer (genocide is bad, mkay?). True, but then you're dealing with an adult who has a hard time denouncing genocide, and I'm not sure that's a good sign.
