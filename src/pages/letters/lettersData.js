            "The past 10 months have been full of anxiety, scarcity, and grief. It would mean a lot if I could have a little beauty and joy in my life for a change. You know, catch a comedy  show, a movie, an art exhibit, go to the aquarium, get some painkillers and flu medicine, finish an art project, things like this. ",

            "Maybe I’ll even have some food from a plate instead of a dumpster. You heard right. Ten years of my “credentials cannot be confirmed” and life becomes indecent and empty – which is why I’m protesting like this. If you feel generous, there’s a link in my signature and please know that what may seem little to you is a treasure to me.",

            "Advocate for me, take my side. I never had anyone in my corner, my parents were my most relentless detractors. Be their opposite, tell the powers that be that you do see me, that you are not okay with it, that I’m worth more alive than dead. Even if it doesn't change the outcome, for me it would be a ray of light in a dark room.",

            "Without me you’ll make a significant impact, sure. You’ll show what’s possible, how it might work, promising results, but I don't think you'll see it done. Something tells me you’ll not be satisfied with anything less than a complete theory of learning and a working model of psychohistory.",

All these experiences reshaped my priorities to a large extent.",

I was in denial about the source of my misery, which were my parents. It is them I was running away from, not you, but it took another 20 years to recognize and accept that I was the product of violence and abuse, torn between existential loneliness and the illusion of love. I hope to live to see our beautiful country again. God bless.",

            "Lucrurile stau cam asa: parintii mei, impreuna cu profesori si administratori de la Emory University, mi-au facut o gluma cu parfum de trafic de carne vie. Au aranjat sa ma accepte la doctorat in psihologie, fara nici o intentie sa-mi dea vreo diploma sau credit pentru contributiile mele, convinsi ca am sa renunt pe parcurs.",

            "M-am intamplat sa excelez. Imi iubesc munca si sunt foarte bun la ceea ce fac. CV-ul meu sta marturie. Dupa ce am absolvit, in 2013, cercetarea mea a inceput sa apara sub alte nume: mentorii mei, alti profi, fosti colegi, o gramada de contributii pentru o gramada de oportunisti. Cu cat ma dovedeam mai mult pe piata muncii (lol), cu atat mai multi se hraneau cu ideile mele.",

            " Alti ani au trecut, eu am tot sarit din adjunct in adjunct, orb la masinatiile astea. Am depus plangeri pana la urma, dar am gasit un sistem corupt, care mi-a inchis usa-n nas, iar si iar.",

            "In 2016 am obtinut cartea verde - pentru cercetare in interesul national (NIW E-26). Cam tot atunci lucrurile au inceput sa mearga din rau in mai rau, dar a fost nevoie de COVID – cand totul s-a oprit – ca sa realizez ca Emory nu imi recunoaste existenta si contributiile si ca profii si staff-ul de la Psihologie si Laney Graduate School mi-au facut o oferta falsa: stiau ca nu imi vor da credit pentru nimic, si ca ma vor trimite inapoi in Romania cu o diploma de jucarie. Adica trafic de carne vie.",

            "Daca nu m-am lasat jecmanit, au ripostat in moduri urate si mi-au facut viata impossibila. Daca nu-mi confirma doctoratul n-am cum sa ma angajez, si an dupa an, m-au inecat datoriile. Acum sunt pe punctul sa fiu evacuat dar nu pot pleca de la adresa asta, pentru ca ma leaga de Emory: mi-au trimis diploma aici, plus alte acte, alumni stuff, etc. Daca plec de aici inainte ca Emory sa imi clarifice situatia, dovezile sederii mele aici vor disparea.",

            "Nu am pe nimeni de partea mea, ba pe toti impotriva, mai ales parintii. Sunt din nou in greva foamei pentru ca nu mai stiu ce sa fac. Doar viata o mai am si am zis ca decat sa ajung pe strazi sau mai rau, mai bine las deshidratarea sa-si faca numarul. Apelez la tine pentru ca esti singurul om care imi vine in minte cu resursele necesare sa-mi schimbe traiectoria.",
