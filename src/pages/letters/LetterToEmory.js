                    </p>

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        I am Dr. Andrei Popa, a son you exploited and abandoned.
                    </p>

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        Members of our community accepted me in the phd program with no intention to credit me for my work and time at Emory. They only kept me around to exploit me and to plagiarize my work, while sabotaging my job search and professional persona behind my back (links below).
                    </p>


                    <p className="paragraph">
                        I graduated ten years ago, in 2013. All this time – it turned out - I applied for jobs with credentials that "cannot be confirmed", an award that does not actually exist, and confidential letters of recommendation that misrepresent me to the point of carricature (Popa v McDowell, 2020).
                    </p>

                    <p className="paragraph">
                        The harder I worked to prove my worth, the more I sank, to my abusers’ gain; my work fuels many research careers, just not mine.
                    </p>


                    <p className="paragraph">
                        You allowed this predatory behavior to proliferate to the point where my work conditions have become untanable and my existence – a cruel joke. Now I am slowly succombing to dehidration because I don't know what else to do: I’m out of both resources and ideas.
                    </p>


                    <p className="paragraph">
                        This is unjust and wastefull. I earned my stripes through hard work and sacrifice. My research program is unique, ambitious, and valuable - just ask my plagiarizers, they know almost all about it. The best of me is ahead, not behind. Instead of letting me fade away, embrace me. You’ll be glad you did.
                    </p>

                            <b>Everything about  is shady: </b>how it emerged; where is located; its emphasis on being impervious to class action lawsuits. <br />

                            I will make a Youtube video on this, but for now notice two things:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    See the <b>disclaimer </b> in the footer, where they specify that they relay the request to the institution and report back what the institution replies. This means that <b>they're not reducing costs</b>, how could they? The institution responds to every request, just not directly. This means that their reason to exist - <i>raison d'etre</i> if you will - is something else.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Verifying a record can be an <b>infinit loop</b>, since the response does not contain the information originally provided and does not specify what information is actually required.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Considering that the company was created in the 90s, it looks like a bad actor injected in society to rig the game on behalf of universities, while keeping them legally safe.
