                    {"The ADHD literature abounds in knowledge about contributing factors, both biological and environmental (Mash & Wolfe, 2013), but their mechanisms of action are still to be identified (Mash & Wolfe, 2013; Mick et. al., 2010). Research on an evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics (ETBD; McDowell, 2004, 2013b) showed that certain experimental contexts produced behavioral symptoms that shared descriptive and functional similarities with core symptoms of ADHD (Popa, 2013). The purpose of this section is to explain how ADHD-like symptoms emerged in ETBD and to explore the implications for the emergence and developmental trajectory of ADHD symptoms in humans."}
