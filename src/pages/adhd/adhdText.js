        abstract: "The ADHD literature abounds in knowledge about contributing factors, both biological and environmental (Mash & Wolfe, 2013), but their mechanisms of action are still to be identified (Mash & Wolfe, 2013; Mick et. al., 2010). Research on an evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics (ETBD; McDowell, 2004, 2013b) showed that certain experimental contexts produced behavioral symptoms that shared descriptive and functional similarities with core symptoms of ADHD (Popa, 2013). The purpose of this section is to explain how ADHD-like symptoms emerged in ETBD and to explore the implications for the emergence and developmental trajectory of ADHD symptoms in humans.",

        "<b>Learning as evolution.</b> The evolutionary account of behavior dynamics conceptualizes behavior as a tool that operates on the environment, with more or less success. Behavioral strategies that prove successful tend to be repeated; those that do not, tend to be abandoned (Skinner, 1981, 1984).",
        "<b>ETBD</b> The computational model discussed here (McDowell, 2004) instantiates the Skinnerian analogy between positive reinforcement and natural selection (Skinner, 1981). If learning - long-term change in behavior and knowledge due to experience - is an emergent property of evolutionary-like principles, then synthetic behavior produced by Darwinian processes should be indistinguishable from the behavior of living agents. For details, see ETBD",
        "<b>Corroborating evidence.</b> Extensive experimentation showed qualitative and quantitative agreement between ETBD and real-world behavior (for a review see McDowell, 2013b).",
        "<b>Predictions and translational relevance.<b/> In addition to recreating known phenomena, ETBD was shown to predict human behavior (Popa, 2013, Phase 2); to inform about mathematical descriptors of behaviors (Popa & McDowell, 2016); and to shed light on the nature and developmental trajectory of ADHD (Popa, 2013 - 2017; Popa & McDowell, 2011, 2016; Popa, Calvin, & McDowell, 2012, 2013, 2014)."

Each surface provides a comprehensive visual overview of the effects of an experimental condition on behavior as a whole. Each surface corresponds to an average z-score (top-right corner). Note that for seven variables, low scores indicate high variability, but for changeovers,  inter-bout intervals, and topographic variability (delta_phenotype),  low scores indicate low behavioral variability.

            "Examining the behavioral constellations above, is difficult to infer the specific configuration of variables that produced it.This is relevant for clinical research because assignment to control and experimental groups is done based on symptoms similarity, which may obscure etiological variability.",

            "This suggests that the studies that failed to find significant connections between dopamine- related genes and ADHD(Li, Sham, Owen, & He, 2007) may have overlooked some environmental variables that could have prevented(or lessened) their expression(e.g., high reinforcement density).",

            "Similarly, in studies that failed to find clinically - relevant improvements in ADHD symptoms from behavioral interventions, participant’s biological predispositions may have overcame the effects of environmental variables.This would explain, for example, why the performance of ADHD- diagnosed children varies with context(Corkum & Siegel, 1993) and why, although many ADHD - diagnosed clients benefit from behavioral interventions, some benefit a lot more than others, as suggested by a recent examination of ~170 studies(Fabiano et.al., 2009).",

            "Finally, they provide an explanation for the differences observed in medication effectiveness: is not unreasonable to assume that environmentally - induced variability, a natural reaction to resource scarcity, (Neuringer, 2004; 2009) may respond less to medication than biologically - induced variability.",

            "In ETBD, these effects were produced by the interaction between high mutation rate, reinforcement rate, magnitude, and changeover delay; in ADHD, these apparent inconsistencies have been attributed to Gene x Environment interactions(G x E; Laucht et.al., 2007).",

            "Clinical research and practice would benefit from complementing assessment of symptoms with a functional analysis of the bio-social context that produced said symptoms. Such analyses, however, cannot be conducted without knowing how and where genes and environments meet and interact and how ADHD symptoms emerge from these interactions."

Non-reinforced emissions, on the other hand, causes the parents for the next generation to be chosen at random (and not on their fitness).

The effects of seldom or weak selection events dissipate faster than the effects of frequent/strong selection events.",

Failure to suppress this network during tasks that require sustained attention or response inhibition was associated with increased levels of behavioral variability (Weissman, Roberts, Visscher, & Woldorff, 2006; Feige, Biscaldi, Saville, Kluckert, & Bender, 2013), presumably by interfering with the activity of task-positive regions, involved in goal-directed activity (Kelly, Uddin, Biswal, Castellanos, & Milham, 2008).",

A period of 1-2 seconds was often enough to noticeably increase sensitivity to reinforcement and to reduce the frequency of changeovers; increasing the length of the interval beyond what seemed like a critical threshold had no further effects (Shull & Pliskoff, 1967; Baum, 1974, 1979; Davison & McCarthy, 1988;  Temple et. al., 1995).
