        "In 2005 I was accepted in the graduate program in Cognition and Behavior at Arizona State University. For my parents this meant loosing control over their favorite toy, so they did something about it.",

        "Somehow - I'll come back to this - they got the Psychology Department of Emory University to offer me a fake spot in their Cognition and Development program and to sabotage me until I quit.",

        "Now, a fake spot, or ghost spot, is one that does not exist in University records. One goes through all the motions without being actually enrolled. It's a thing at Emory.",

        "The task fell in Phil Wolff, a junior faculty on track to tenure at the time. He made me an offer and I accepted. I arrived in Atlanta in August 2005 and the masquerade began. Six months later I was too demoralized to continue, so I took a leave of absence from which no one thought I will return.",

        "This was the first time I was trafficked by Emory University, but not the last.",

        "In 2007 I returned from leave and I joined McDowell's lab. Little did I know that him and his ABAI buddies have decades of experience with stealing ideas, derailing careers, and ruining lives.",

        "Years went by and I was doing well. Seeing that I don't quit they tried to exhaust me, but I loved the research too much to be deterred (or to notice what they were doing). The more they tried, the better I got and, little by little, I became the scholar McDowell pretends to be.",

        "Something had to be done, apparently, and they found the right man for the job: Ralph Woolfolk, a young and ambitious detective with Atlanta PD. He fabricated an allegation of rape against me, pretended to investigate it, and interviewed my recommenders in the process. My attorneys (Aurora and LaScala) played along, making the whole thing appear legit. With no intention to arrest me, they ended my career before it began.",

        "The next years were just mental anguish and desperate attempts to prove my worth as a scholar. These attempts ended up boosting the careers of other posers (e.g., Keneth Carter)."
