                            During the quarantine I had a workout streak of 450 days. without missing a single one, no matter what. I picked up running and I was preparing for my first race.

                            The silverlining is that if I live through this I get to rebuild myself from ground up, on my own terms.

                            &nbsp;, maybe I’ll build a course around it someday. I’ll share my progress as I go. If you find this useful please consider a modest contribution at <a href="https://ko-fi.com/fixmachina" target="blank">ko-fi.com/fixmachina</a>.&nbsp;More examples and code coming soon.

Since then I lost 74 pounds, almost 40% of my body weight. Today I'm 116 pounds of indignation and resolve.

Mine vary between 70 and 80, which tells me that my body has no more fat to turn into glucose. <i> Device</i>:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glucose-Monitor-Glucometer-Lancets-Solution/dp/B08LYC288R/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2ZXT01O6L5YPF&keywords=blood+glucose+monitor&qid=1698795727&sprefix=bloodglu%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1">Metene TD-4116 Blood Glucose Monitor Kit</a>
